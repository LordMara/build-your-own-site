                        <p><quoteblock cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Pizza is a yeasted flatbread typically 
                            topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. 
                            It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments.</quoteblock></p>

                            The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from Gaeta in Central Italy. 
                            Modern pizza was invented in Naples, Italy, and the dish and its variants have since become popular 
                            and common in many areas of the world. In 2009, upon Italy's request, 
                            Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish.
                             Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded in 1984 
                             with headquarters in Naples, aims to "promote and protect... the true Neapolitan pizza".</quoteblock></p>

                        <h2>Spaghetti bolognese</h2>

                        <p><quoteblock cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolognese_sauce#Spaghetti_bolognese">
                            Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called spaghetti alla bolognese, 
                            or colloquially spag bol or just spaghetti) is a pasta dish consisting of spaghetti 
                            served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine and herbs; 
                            ometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats. 
                            In this sense it is actually more similar to Neapolitan ragu from the south of Italy 
                            than the northern Bolognese version of Ragu. Often accused of 'inauthenticity' when encountered by Italians abroad, 
                            it may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to spaghetti than is common in some Italian spaghetti dishes, 
                            and the sauce may be laid on top of the spaghetti (rather than being mixed into it, as Italian custom) 
                            or even served separately from it (so that the diner can mix to his or her preference). 
                            It is often served with grated parmesan on top as in Italy, but local cheeses, 
                            such as grated cheddar are also often substituted. 
                            The sauce is commonly referred to as Bolognese sauce or just spaghetti sauce, 
                            but is actually closer to a Southern or Central Italian style of pasta dish, 
                            as true Bolognese sauce would be served only with tagliatelle ribbons rather than spaghetti in Italy.</quoteblock></p>
                            
                            <p><quoteblock cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolognese_sauce#Spaghetti_bolognese">
                            While spaghetti Bolognese is mostly unheard of in Italy itself, 
                            it is a very popular dish in Northern and Western parts of Europe, 
                            as well as in North America, Australia and New Zealand. The origins of the dish are unclear, 
                            but it may have started as a hybrid version of the ragù alla bolognese more influenced 
                            by the southern tomato-rich style of Neapolitan ragu and probably evolved from early twentieth century 
                            immigration to the UK or United States as a form of fusion between Italian and local cuisine. 
                            Bolognese sauce often also forms the basis of lasagna in the countries where it is common, 
                            just as ragù is used in the lasagna in Italy.</quoteblock></p>
